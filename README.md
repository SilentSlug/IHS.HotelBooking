# IHS.HotelBooking

I have created a .Net Core 3.1 Console Application for the purpose of this test. The option was given to either use unit tests, or write test code in a console application to execute the solution. I went with the latter option as I feel this is a better way to demonstrate the requirement around using threads safely and efficiently.

## Notes for reviewer:

- I split up the tasks into 2 branches/PRs for ease of reviewing.
- Both PRs have been merged into master so the final product is there.
- I have made sure to commit smaller frequent updates so you can view the incremental progression.
- Code has been commented where appropriate

Thanks for taking the time to review!
